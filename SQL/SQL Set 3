Q101.Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.
If the user only has one activity, return that one. A user cannot perform more than one activity at the
same time.
Return the result table in any orde

Ans: 
SELECT 
    username,
    activity,
    startDate,
    endDate
FROM (
SELECT
    *,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY username ORDER BY startDate DESC) as rnk,
    COUNT(activity) OVER(PARTITION BY username) as cnt
FROM UserActivity
    ) x
WHERE rnk = 2 OR cnt < 2;

Q102.Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. Order your output by
the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same
last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

Ans: SELECT name FROM students WHERE marks>75 ORDER BY SUBSTRING(name, -3, 3), id;

Q103.Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in
Employee having a salary greater than $2000 per month who have been employees for less than 10
months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id

Ans: SELECT name FROM employee WHERE salary > 2000 AND months < 10 ORDER BY employee_id;

Q104.Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths.
Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
● Equilateral: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
● Isosceles: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
● Scalene: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths.
● Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Ans: 
SELECT CASE
WHEN ((t.A+t.B) <=t.c ) THEN 'Not A Triangle'
WLSE
    CASE
    WHEN (t.A=t.B) AND (t.B=t.c) THEN 'Equilateral'
    ELSE
        CASE
        WHEN (t.A = t.B) or (t.A = t.C) or (t.B = t.C) THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE
            'Scalene'
        END
    END
END
FROM triangles as t;

Q105.Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the
EMPLOYEES table, but did not realise her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the
calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries
with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries),
and round it up to the next integer.

Ans:SELECT CEIL(AVG(salary)) - AVG(REPLACE(salary,'0','')) FROM EMPLOYEES;

Q106.We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary * months worked, and the
maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table.
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of
employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated
integers

Ans: SELECT MAX(months*salary) as earnings, COUNT(month*salary) FROM employee GROUP BY earnings ORDER BY earnings DESC ;

Q107.1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by
the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For
example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of occurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in
ascending order, and output them in the following format:
Level - Medium
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
2. where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and
[occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same
[occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.
Input Format

Ans:
SELECT CONCAT(name, '(',left(occupation,1),')') 
FROM occupations 
ORDER BY name;

SELECT 'There are a total of ' ,COUNT(occupation) ,CONCAT(lower(occupation), 's.') 
FROM occupations
GROUP BY occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(occupation) ,occupation;

Q108.Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and
displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor,
Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.
Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupatiom.

Ans:
